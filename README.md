# A simple node.js image resize service

This repository is a modification of https://github.com/tbasse/resize-server that is published by me to npm in order to make the image resizing service an express module.

I thank the author of the original repository for making such a great service.

## Installation

```
npm i --save express-resize-img
```

##Â Using in express

```js
let resizeApp = require('express-resize-img'); 
let express = require('express');
let app = express();

// hook the resizing service to a path on your application
app.use('/resize', resizeApp);

// run
app.listen(12345); 
```

## Usage

### Options

**`resize`**

- `width`x`height` stretch to dimensions
